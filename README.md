# Objective 

- What is the key pain point? 

The Head of Marketing wants to find out the under represented demographic groups to determine where marketing campaigns should be improved.


- What is the ideal solution? 

To create a pivot chart that indicates the least sales. The chart should present the following information: 
- the age group
- the country 
- the gender
  

This will help the marketing team make informed decisions about where marketing improvements should be made.

# User story 

As the Head of Marketing, I want to use a pivot table that analyses sales for our bicycle company.

This dashboard should allow me to identify the the age group and country with the least sales.

With this information, I can make more informed decisions about where to improve sales.


# Data source 

- What data is needed to achieve our objective?

We need data on the company's sales for the past 5 years, to see how sales have been going. The data should include the following:
- sales made
- country
- age group
- gender



- Where is the data coming from? 
The data is sourced from the company's database(an Excel extract), [see here to find it.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavyadhingra00020/top-100-social-media-influencers-2024-countrywise?resource=download)
